title: Attention Guided Deep Supervision Model for Prostate Segmentation in Multisite
  Heterogeneous MRI Data
abstract: Prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia are common diseases in
  men and require early and accurate diagnosis for optimal treatment. Standard diagnostic
  tests such as the prostate-specific antigen test and digital rectal examination
  are inconvenient. Thus, non-invasive methods such as magnetic resonance imaging
  (MRI) and automated image analysis are increasingly utilised to facilitate and improve
  prostate diagnostics. Segmentation is a vital part of the prostate image analysis
  pipeline, and deep neural networks are now the tool of choice to automate this task.
  In this work, we benchmark various deep neural networks for 3D prostate segmentation
  using four different publicly available datasets and one private dataset. We show
  that popular networks such as U-Net trained on one dataset typically generalise
  poorly when tested on others due to data heterogeneity. Aiming to address this issue,
  we propose a novel deep-learning architecture for prostate whole-gland segmentation
  in T2-weighted MRI images that exploits various techniques such as pyramid pooling,
  concurrent spatial and channel squeeze and excitation, and deep supervision. Our
  extensive experiments demonstrate that it performs superiorly without requiring
  special adaptation to any specific dataset.
