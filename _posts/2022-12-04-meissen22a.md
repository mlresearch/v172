title: On the Pitfalls of Using the Residual Error as Anomaly Score
abstract: Many current state-of-the-art methods for anomaly localization in medical
  images rely on calculating a residual image between a potentially anomalous input
  image and its ("healthy") reconstruction. As the reconstruction of the unseen anomalous
  region should be erroneous, this yields large residuals as a score to detect anomalies
  in medical images. However, this assumption does not take into account residuals
  resulting from imperfect reconstructions of the machine learning models used. Such
  errors can easily overshadow residuals of interest and therefore strongly question
  the use of residual images as scoring function. Our work explores this fundamental
  problem of residual images in detail. We theoretically define the problem and thoroughly
  evaluate the influence of intensity and texture of anomalies against the effect
  of imperfect reconstructions in a series of experiments.
