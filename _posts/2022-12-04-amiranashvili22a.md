title: Learning Shape Reconstruction from Sparse Measurements with Neural Implicit
  Functions
abstract: 'Reconstructing anatomical shapes from sparse or partial measurements relies
  on prior knowledge of shape variations that occur within a given population. Such
  shape priors are learned from example shapes, obtained by segmenting volumetric
  medical images. For existing models, the resolution of a learned shape prior is
  limited to the resolution of the training data. However, in clinical practice, volumetric
  images are often acquired with highly anisotropic voxel sizes, e.g. to reduce image
  acquisition time in MRI or radiation exposure in CT imaging. The missing shape information
  between the slices prohibits existing methods to learn a high-resolution shape prior.
  We introduce a method for high-resolution shape reconstruction from sparse measurements
  without relying on high-resolution ground truth for training. Our method is based
  on neural implicit shape representations and learns a continuous shape prior only
  from highly anisotropic segmentations. Furthermore, it is able to learn from shapes
  with a varying field of view and can reconstruct from various sparse input configurations.
  We demonstrate its effectiveness on two anatomical structures: vertebra and distal
  femur, and successfully reconstruct high-resolution shapes from sparse segmentations,
  using as few as three orthogonal slices.'
