title: 'TorchXRayVision: A library of chest X-ray datasets and models'
abstract: TorchXRayVision is an open source software library for working with chest
  X-ray datasets and deep learning models. It provides a common interface and common
  pre-processing chain for a wide set of publicly available chest X-ray datasets.
  In addition, a number of classification and representation learning models with
  different architectures, trained on different data combinations, are available through
  the library to serve as baselines or feature extractors.
