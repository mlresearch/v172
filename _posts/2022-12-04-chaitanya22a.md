title: Automatic planning of liver tumor thermal ablation using deep reinforcement
  learning
abstract: Thermal ablation is a promising minimally invasive intervention to treat
  liver tumors. It requires a meticulous planning phase where the electrode trajectory
  from the skin surface to the tumor inside the liver as well as the ablation protocol
  are defined to reach a complete tumor ablation while considering multiple clinical
  constraints such as avoiding too much damage to healthy tissue. The planning is
  usually done manually based on 2D views of pre-operative CT images and can be extremely
  challenging for large or irregularly shaped tumors. Conventional optimization methods
  have been proposed to automate this complex task, but they suffer from high computation
  time. To alleviate this drawback, we propose to leverage a deep reinforcement learning
  (DRL) approach to find the optimal electrode trajectory that satisfies all the clinical
  constraints and does not require any labels in training. Here, we define a custom
  environment as the 3D mask with tumor, surrounding organs, skin labels along with
  an electrode line and ablation zone. An agent, represented by a neural network,
  interacts with the custom environment by displacing the electrode and therefore
  can learn an optimal policy. The reward assignment is done based on the clinical
  constraints. We explore discrete and continuous action-based approaches with double
  deep Q networks and proximal policy optimization (PPO), respectively. We perform
  an evaluation on the publicly available liver tumor segmentation (LITs) challenge
  dataset and obtain solutions that satisfy all clinical constraints comparable to
  the conventional method. The DRL method does not need any post-processing steps,
  allowing a mean inference time of 13.3 seconds per subject compared to the conventional
  optimization method’s mean time of 135 seconds. Moreover, the best DRL method (PPO)
  yields a valid solution irrespective of the tumor location within the liver that
  demonstrates its robustness.
