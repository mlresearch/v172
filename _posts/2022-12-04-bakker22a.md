title: On learning adaptive acquisition policies for undersampled multi-coil MRI reconstruction
abstract: 'Most current approaches to undersampled multi-coil MRI reconstruction focus
  on learning the reconstruction model for a fixed, equidistant acquisition trajectory.
  In this paper, we study the problem of joint learning of the reconstruction model
  together with acquisition policies. To this end, we extend the End-to-End Variational
  Network with learnable acquisition policies that can adapt to different data points.
  We validate our model on a coil-compressed version of the large scale undersampled
  multi-coil fastMRI dataset using two undersampling factors: $4\times$ and $8\times$.
  Our experiments show on-par performance with the learnable non-adaptive and handcrafted
  equidistant strategies at $4\times$, and an observed improvement of more than $2%$
  in SSIM at $8\times$ acceleration, suggesting that potentially-adaptive $k$-space
  acquisition trajectories can improve reconstructed image quality for larger acceleration
  factors. However, and perhaps surprisingly, our best performing policies learn to
  be explicitly non-adaptive.'
