title: 'MAF-Net: Multi-branch Anchor-Free Detector for Polyp Localization and Classification
  in Colonoscopy'
abstract: Colorectal polyps are abnormal tissues growing on the intima of the colon
  or rectum with a high risk of developing into colorectal cancer, the third leading
  cause of cancer death worldwide. The most common types of colorectal polyps include
  inflammatory, hyperplastic, and adenomatous polyps. Adenomatous polyps are the most
  dangerous type of polyp with the potential to become cancerous. Therefore, the prevention
  of colorectal cancer heavily depends on the identification and removal of adenomatous
  polyps. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to assist physicians to localize,
  identify, and remove adenomatous polyps in colonoscopy. The framework consists of
  an anchor-free polyp detection branch for detecting and localizing polyps and a
  classification branch for global feature extraction and pathology prediction. Furthermore,
  we propose a foreground attention module to generate local features from the foreground
  subnet in the detection branch, which are combined with the global feature in the
  classification branch to enhance the pathology prediction performance. We collect
  a dataset that contains 6,059 images with 6,827 object-level annotations. This dataset
  is the first large-scale polyp pathology dataset with both object segmentation annotations
  and pathology labels. Experiment results show that our proposed framework outperforms
  traditional CNN-based classifiers on polyp pathology classification and anchor-based
  detectors on polyp detection and localization.
