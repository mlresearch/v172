title: Negative Evidence Matters in Interpretable Histology Image Classification
abstract: 'Using only global image-class labels, weakly-supervised learning methods,
  such as class activation mapping, allow training CNNs to jointly classify an image,
  and locate regions of interest associated with the predicted class. However, without
  any guidance at the pixel level, such methods may yield inaccurate regions. This
  problem is known to be more challenging with histology images than with natural
  ones, since objects are less salient, structures have more variations, and foreground
  and background regions have stronger similarities. Therefore, computer vision methods
  for visual interpretation of CNNs may not directly apply. In this paper, a simple
  yet efficient method based on a composite loss is proposed to learn information
  from the fully negative samples (i.e., samples without positive regions), and thereby
  reduce false positives/negatives. Our new loss function contains two complementary
  terms: the first exploits positive evidence collected from the CNN classifier, while
  the second leverages the fully negative samples from training data. In particular,
  a pre-trained CNN is equipped with a decoder that allows refining the regions of
  interest. The CNN is exploited to collect both positive and negative evidence at
  the pixel level to train the decoder. Our method called NEGEV benefits from the
  fully negative samples that naturally occur in the data, without any additional
  supervision signals beyond image-class labels. Extensive experiments show that our
  proposed method can substantial outperform related state-of-art methods on GlaS
  (public benchmark for colon cancer), and Camelyon16 (patch-based benchmark for breast
  cancer using three different backbones). Our results highlight the benefits of using
  both positive and negative evidence, the first obtained from a classifier, and the
  other naturally available in datasets.'
