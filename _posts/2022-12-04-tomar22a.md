title: 'OptTTA: Learnable Test-Time Augmentation for Source-Free Medical Image Segmentation
  Under Domain Shift'
abstract: As distribution shifts are inescapable in realistic clinical scenarios due
  to inconsistencies in imaging protocols, scanner vendors, and across different centers,
  well-trained deep models incur a domain generalization problem in unseen environments.
  Despite a myriad of model generalization techniques to circumvent this issue, their
  broad applicability is impeded as (i) source training data may not be accessible
  after deployment due to privacy regulations, (ii) the availability of adequate test
  domain samples is often impractical, and (iii) such model generalization methods
  are not well-calibrated, often making unreliable overconfident predictions. This
  paper proposes a novel learnable test-time augmentation, namely OptTTA, tailored
  specifically to alleviate large domain shifts for the source-free medical image
  segmentation task. OptTTA enables efficiently generating augmented views of test
  input, resembling the style of private source images and bridging a domain gap between
  training and test data. Our proposed method explores optimal learnable test-time
  augmentation sub-policies that provide lower predictive entropy and match the feature
  statistics stored in the BatchNorm layers of the pretrained source model without
  requiring access to training source samples. Thorough evaluation and ablation studies
  on challenging multi-center and multi-vendor MRI datasets of three anatomies have
  demonstrated the performance superiority of OptTTA over prior-arts test-time augmentation
  and model adaptation methods. Additionally, the generalization capabilities and
  effectiveness of OptTTA are evaluated in terms of aleatoric uncertainty and model
  calibration analyses. Our PyTorch code implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/devavratTomar/OptTTA.
