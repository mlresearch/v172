title: Deep Learning for Model Correction in Cardiac Electrophysiological Imaging
abstract: Imaging the electrical activity of the heart can be achieved with invasive
  catheterisation. However, the resulting data are sparse and noisy. Mathematical
  modelling of cardiac electrophysiology can help the analysis but solving the associated
  mathematical systems can become unfeasible. It is often computationally demanding,
  for instance when solving for different patient conditions. We present a new framework
  to model the dynamics of cardiac electrophysiology at lower cost. It is based on
  the integration of a low-fidelity physical model and a learning component implemented
  here via neural networks. The latter acts as a complement to the physical part,
  and handles all quantities and dynamics that the simplified physical model neglects.
  We demonstrate that this framework allows us to reproduce the complex dynamics of
  the transmembrane potential and to correctly identify the relevant physical parameters,
  even when only partial measurements are available. This combined model-based and
  data-driven approach could improve cardiac electrophysiological imaging and provide
  predictive tools.
