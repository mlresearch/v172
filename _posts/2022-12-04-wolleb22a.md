title: Diffusion Models for Implicit Image Segmentation Ensembles
abstract: Diffusion models have shown impressive performance for generative modelling
  of images. In this paper, we present a novel semantic segmentation method based
  on diffusion models. By modifying the training and sampling scheme, we show that
  diffusion models can perform lesion segmentation of medical images. To generate
  an image-specific segmentation, we train the model on the ground truth segmentation,
  and use the image as a prior during training and in every step during the sampling
  process. With the given stochastic sampling process, we can generate a distribution
  of segmentation masks. This property allows us to compute pixel-wise uncertainty
  maps of the segmentation, and allows an implicit ensemble of segmentations that
  increases the segmentation performance. We evaluate our method on the BRATS2020
  dataset for brain tumor segmentation. Compared to state-of-the-art segmentation
  models, our approach yields good segmentation results and, additionally, detailed
  uncertainty maps.
