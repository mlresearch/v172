title: Segmentation-Consistent Probabilistic Lesion Counting
abstract: Lesion counts are important indicators of disease severity, patient prognosis,
  and treatment efficacy, yet counting as a task in medical imaging is often overlooked
  in favor of segmentation. This work introduces a novel continuously differentiable
  function that maps lesion segmentation predictions to lesion count probability distributions
  in a consistent manner. The proposed end-to-end approach—which consists of voxel
  clustering, lesion-level voxel probability aggregation, and Poisson-binomial counting—is
  non-parametric and thus offers a robust and consistent way to augment lesion segmentation
  models with post hoc counting capabilities. Experiments on Gadolinium-enhancing
  lesion counting demonstrate that our method outputs accurate and well-calibrated
  count distributions that capture meaningful uncertainty information. They also reveal
  that our model is suitable for multi-task learning of lesion segmentation, is efficient
  in low data regimes, and is robust to adversarial attacks.
