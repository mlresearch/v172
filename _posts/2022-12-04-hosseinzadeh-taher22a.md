title: 'CAiD: Context-Aware Instance Discrimination for Self-supervised Learning in
  Medical Imaging'
abstract: 'Recently, self-supervised instance discrimination methods have achieved
  significant success in learning visual representations from unlabeled photographic
  images. However, given the marked differences between photographic and medical images,
  the efficacy of instance-based objectives, focusing on learning the most discriminative
  global features in the image (i.e., wheels in bicycle), remains unknown in medical
  imaging. Our preliminary analysis showed that high global similarity of medical
  images in terms of anatomy hampers instance discrimination methods for capturing
  a set of distinct features, negatively impacting their performance on medical downstream
  tasks. To alleviate this limitation, we have developed a simple yet effective self-supervised
  framework, called Context-Aware instance Discrimination (CAiD). CAiD aims to improve
  instance discrimination learning by providing finer and more discriminative information
  encoded from a diverse local context of unlabeled medical images. We conduct a systematic
  analysis to investigate the utility of the learned features from a three-pronged
  perspective: (i) generalizability and transferability, (ii) separability in the
  embedding space, and (iii) reusability. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that
  CAiD (1) enriches representations learned from existing instance discrimination
  methods; (2)  delivers more discriminative features by adequately capturing finer
  contextual information from individual medial images; and (3) improves reusability
  of low/mid-level features compared to standard instance discriminative methods.
