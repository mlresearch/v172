title: 'LILE: Look In-Depth before Looking Elsewhere – A Dual Attention Network using
  Transformers for Cross-Modal Information Retrieval in Histopathology Archives'
abstract: "The volume of available data has grown dramatically in recent years in
  many applications. Furthermore, the age of networks that used multiple modalities
  separately has practically ended. Therefore, enabling bidirectional cross-modality
  data retrieval capable of processing has become a requirement for many domains and
  disciplines of research. This is especially true in the medical field, as data comes
  in a multitude of types, including various types of images and reports as well as
  molecular data.\r Most contemporary works apply cross attention to highlight the
  essential elements of an image or text in relation to the other modalities and try
  to match them together. However, regardless of their importance in their own modality,
  these approaches usually consider features of each modality equally. In this study,
  self-attention as an additional loss term will be proposed to enrich the internal
  representation provided into the cross attention module. This work suggests a novel
  architecture with a new loss term to help represent images and texts in the joint
  latent space. Experiment results on two benchmark datasets, i.e. MS-COCO and ARCH,
  show the effectiveness of the proposed method."
