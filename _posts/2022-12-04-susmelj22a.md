title: Signal Domain Learning Approach for Optoacoustic Image Reconstruction from
  Limited View Data
abstract: Multi-spectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) relies on optical excitation
  of tissues with subsequent detection of the generated ultrasound waves.Optimal image
  quality in MSOT is achieved by detection of signals from a broad tomographic view.However,
  due to physical constraints and other cost-related considerations, most imaging
  systems are implemented with probes having limited tomographic coverage around the
  imaged object, such as linear array transducers often employed for clinical ultrasound
  (US) imaging.MSOT image reconstruction from limited-view data results in arc-shaped
  image artifacts and disrupted shape of the vascular structures. Deep learning methods
  have previously been used to recover MSOT images from incomplete tomographic data,
  albeit poor performance was attained when training with data from simulations or
  other imaging modalities.We propose a two-step method consisting of i) style transfer
  for domain adaptation between simulated and experimental MSOT signals, and ii) supervised
  training on simulated data to recover missing tomographic signals in realistic clinical
  data. The method is shown capable of correcting images reconstructed from sub-optimal
  probe geometries using only signal domain data without the need for training with
  ground truth (GT) full-view images.
