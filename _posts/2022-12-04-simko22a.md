title: MRI bias field correction with an implicitly trained CNN
abstract: In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), bias fields are difficult to correct
  since they are inherently unknown. They cause intra-volume intensity inhomogeneities
  which limit the performance of subsequent automatic medical imaging tasks, \eg,
  tissue-based segmentation. Since the ground truth is unavailable, training a supervised
  machine learning solution requires approximating the bias fields, which limits the
  resulting method. We introduce implicit training which sidesteps the inherent lack
  of data and allows the training of machine learning solutions without ground truth.
  We describe how training a model implicitly for bias field correction allows using
  non-medical data for training, achieving a highly generalized model. The implicit
  approach was compared to a more traditional training based on medical data. Both
  models were compared to an optimized N4ITK method, with evaluations on six datasets.
  The implicitly trained model improved the homogeneity of all encountered medical
  data, and it generalized better for a range of anatomies, than the model trained
  traditionally. The model achieves a significant speed-up over an optimized N4ITK
  method—by a factor of $100$, and after training, it also requires no parameters
  to tune. For tasks such as bias field correction—where ground truth is generally
  not available, but the characteristics of the corruption are known—implicit training
  promises to be a fruitful alternative for highly generalized solutions.
