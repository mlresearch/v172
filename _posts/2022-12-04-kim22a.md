title: 'PILLET-GAN: Pixel-Level Lesion Traversal Generative Adversarial Network for
  Pneumonia Localization'
abstract: he study of pneumonia localization focus on the problem of accurate lesion
  localization in the thoracic X-ray image. It is crucial to provide precisely localized
  regions to users. It can lay out the basis of the model decision by comparing the
  X-ray image between the ‘Healthy’ and ‘Disease’ classes. In particular, for the
  medical image analysis, it is essential not only to make a correct prediction for
  the disease but also to provide evidence to support accurate predictions. Many generative
  adversarial networks (GAN) based approaches are employed to show the pixel-level
  changes via domain translation technique to address this issue. Although previous
  research tried to improve localization performance by understanding the domain’s
  attributes for better image translation, it remains challenging to capture the specific
  category’s pixel-level changes. For this reason, we focus on the stage of understanding
  the category attributes. We propose a Pixel-Level Lesion Traversal Generative Adversarial
  Network (PILLET-GAN) that mines spatial features for the category via spatial attention
  technique and fuses them into an original feature map extracted from the generator
  for better domain translation. Our experimental results show that PILLET-GAN achieves
  superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art models on qualitative and
  quantitative results on the RSNA-pneumonia dataset. and quantitative results on
