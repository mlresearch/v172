title: Implicit Neural Representations for Deformable Image Registration
abstract: Deformable medical image registration has in past years been revolutionized
  by the use of convolutional neural networks. These methods surpass conventional
  image registration techniques in speed but not in accuracy. Here, we present an
  alternative approach to leveraging neural networks for image registration. Instead
  of using a convolutional neural network to predict the transformation between images,
  we optimize a multi-layer perceptron to represent this transformation function.
  Using recent insights from differentiable rendering, we show how such an implicit
  deformable image registration (IDIR) model can be naturally combined with regularization
  terms based on standard automatic differentiation techniques. We demonstrate the
  effectiveness of this model on 4D chest CT registration in the DIR-LAB data set
  and find that a three-layer multi-layer perceptron with periodic activation functions
  outperforms all published deep learning-based results on this problem, without any
  folding and without the need for training data. The model is implemented using standard
  deep learning libraries and flexible enough to be extended to include different
  losses, regularizers, and optimization schemes.
