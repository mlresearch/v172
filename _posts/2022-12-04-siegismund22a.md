title: Self-Supervised Representation Learning for High-Content Screening
abstract: Biopharma drug discovery requires a set of approaches to find, produce,
  and test the safety of drugs for clinical application. A crucial part involves image-based
  screening of cell culture models where single cells are stained with appropriate
  markers to visually distinguish between disease and healthy states. In practice,
  such image-based screening experiments are frequently performed using highly scalable
  and automated multichannel microscopy instruments. This automation enables parallel
  screening against large panels of marketed drugs with known function. However, the
  large data volume produced by such instruments hinders a systematic inspection by
  human experts, which consequently leads to an extensive and biased data curation
  process for supervised phenotypic endpoint classification. To overcome this limitation,
  we propose a novel approach for learning an embedding of phenotypic endpoints, without
  any supervision. We employ the concept of archetypal analysis, in which pseudo-labels
  are extracted based on biologically reasonable endpoints. Subsequently, we use a
  self-supervised triplet network to learn a phenotypic embedding which is used for
  visual inspection and top-down assay quality control. Extensive experiments on two
  industry-relevant assays demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art
  unsupervised and supervised approaches.
