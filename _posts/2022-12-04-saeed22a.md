title: Is it Possible to Predict MGMT Promoter Methylation from Brain Tumor MRI Scans
  using Deep Learning Models?
abstract: Glioblastoma is a common brain malignancy that tends to occur in older adults
  and is almost always lethal. The effectiveness of chemotherapy, being the standard
  treatment for most cancer types, can be improved if a particular genetic sequence
  in the tumor known as MGMT promoter is methylated. However, to identify the state
  of the MGMT promoter, the conventional approach is to perform a biopsy for genetic
  analysis, which is time and effort consuming. A couple of recent publications proposed
  a connection between the MGMT promoter state and the MRI scans of the tumor and
  hence suggested the use of deep learning models for this purpose. Therefore, in
  this work, we use one of the most extensive datasets, BraTS 2021, to study the potency
  of employing deep learning solutions, including 2D and 3D CNN models and vision
  transformers. After conducting a thorough analysis of the modelsâ€™ performance, we
  concluded that there seems to be no connection between the MRI scans and the state
  of the MGMT promoter.
