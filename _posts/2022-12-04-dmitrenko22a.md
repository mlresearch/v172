title: Comparing representations of biological data learned with different AI paradigms,
  augmenting and cropping strategies
abstract: 'Recent advances in computer vision and robotics enabled automated large-scale
  biological image analysis. Various machine learning approaches have been successfully
  applied to phenotypic profiling. However, it remains unclear how they compare in
  terms of biological feature extraction. In this study, we propose a simple CNN architecture
  and implement 4 different representation learning approaches. We train 16 deep learning
  setups on the 770k cancer cell images dataset under identical conditions, using
  different augmenting and cropping strategies. We compare the learned representations
  by evaluating multiple metrics for each of three downstream tasks: i) distance-based
  similarity analysis of known drugs, ii) classification of drugs versus controls,
  iii) clustering within cell lines. We also compare training times and memory usage.
  Among all tested setups, multi-crops and random augmentations generally improved
  performance across tasks, as expected. Strikingly, self-supervised (implicit contrastive
  learning) models showed competitive performance being up to 11 times faster to train.
  Self-supervised regularized learning required the most of memory and computation
  to deliver arguably the most informative features. We observe that no single combination
  of augmenting and cropping strategies consistently results in top performance across
  tasks and recommend prospective research directions.'
