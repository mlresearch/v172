title: Personalized Prediction of Future Lesion Activity and Treatment Effect in Multiple
  Sclerosis from Baseline MRI
abstract: Precision medicine for chronic diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS)
  involves choosing a treatment which best balances efficacy and side effects/preferences
  for individual patients. Making this choice as early as possible is important, as
  delays in finding an effective therapy can lead to irreversible disability accrual.
  To this end, we present the first deep neural network model for individualized treatment
  decisions from baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (with clinical information
  if available) for MS patients which (a) predicts future new and enlarging T2 weighted
  (NE-T2) lesion counts on follow-up MRI on multiple treatments and (b) estimates
  the conditional average treatment effect (CATE), as defined by the predicted future
  suppression of NE-T2 lesions, between different treatment options relative to placebo.
  Our model is validated on a proprietary federated dataset of 1817 multi-sequence
  MRIs acquired from MS patients during four multi-centre randomized clinical trials.
  Our framework achieves high average precision in the binarized regression of future
  NE-T2 lesions on five different treatments, identifies heterogeneous treatment effects,
  and provides a personalized treatment recommendation that accounts for treatment-associated
  risk (side effects, patient preference, administration difficulties,...).
