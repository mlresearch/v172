title: 'ECONet: Efficient Convolutional Online Likelihood Network for Scribble-based
  Interactive Segmentation'
abstract: 'Automatic segmentation of lung lesions associated with COVID-19 in CT images
  requires large amount of annotated volumes. Annotations mandate expert knowledge
  and are time-intensive to obtain through fully manual segmentation methods. Additionally,
  lung lesions have large inter-patient variations, with some pathologies having similar
  visual appearance as healthy lung tissues. This poses a challenge when applying
  existing semi-automatic interactive segmentation techniques for data labelling.
  To address these challenges, we propose an efficient convolutional neural networks
  (CNNs) that can be learned online while the annotator provides scribble-based interaction.
  To accelerate learning from only the samples labelled through user-interactions,
  a patch-based approach is used for training the network. Moreover, we use weighted
  cross-entropy loss to address the class imbalance that may result from user-interactions.
  During online inference, the learned network is applied to the whole input volume
  using a fully convolutional approach. We compare our proposed method with state-of-the-art
  using synthetic scribbles and show that it outperforms existing methods on the task
  of annotating lung lesions associated with COVID-19, achieving 16% higher Dice score
  while reducing execution time by 3Ã— and requiring 9000 lesser scribble-sbased labelled
  voxels. Due to the online learning aspect, our approach adapts quickly to user input,
  resulting in high quality segmentation labels. Source code for ECONet is available
