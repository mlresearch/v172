title: Denoising Autoencoders for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Brain MRI
abstract: Pathological brain lesions exhibit diverse appearance in brain images, making
  it difficult to train supervised detection solutions due to the lack of comprehensive
  data and annotations. Thus, in this work we tackle unsupervised anomaly detection,
  using only healthy data for training with the aim of detecting unseen anomalies
  at test time. Many current approaches employ autoencoders with restrictive architectures
  (i.e. containing information bottlenecks) that tend to give poor reconstructions
  of not only the anomalous but also the normal parts of the brain. Instead, we investigate
  classical denoising autoencoder models that do not require bottlenecks and can employ
  skip connections to give high resolution fidelity. We design a simple noise generation
  method of upscaling low-resolution noise that enables high-quality reconstructions.
  We find that with appropriate noise generation, denoising autoencoder reconstruction
  errors generalize to hyperintense lesion segmentation and reach state of the art
  performance for unsupervised tumor detection in brain MRI data, beating more complex
  methods such as variational autoencoders. We believe this provides a strong and
  easy-to-implement baseline for further research into unsupervised anomaly detection.
