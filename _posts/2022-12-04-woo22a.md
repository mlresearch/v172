title: Anomaly-Aware 3D Segmentation of Knee Magnetic Resonance Images
abstract: In medical imaging, anatomical structures under examination often contain
  anomalies or pathologies making automated segmentation challenging in these situations.
  Hence, the robust segmentation of anatomical structures in the presence of anomalies
  represents an important step within the medical image analysis field. In this work,
  we show how popular U-Net-based neural networks can be used for detecting anomalies
  in the knee from 3D magnetic resonance (MR) images in patients with varying grades
  of osteoarthritis (OA). We also show that the extracted information can be utilized
  for downstream tasks such as parallel segmentation of anatomical structures along
  with associated anomalies such as bone marrow lesions (BMLs). For anomaly detection,
  a U-Net-based model was adopted to inpaint the region of interest in images so that
  the anomalous regions can be replaced with close to normal appearances. The difference
  between the original image and the inpainted image was then used to highlight the
  anomalies. The extracted information was then used to improve the segmentation of
  bones and cartilages; in particular, the anomaly-aware segmentation mechanism provided
  a significant reduction in surface distance error in the segmentation of knee MR
  images containing severe anomalies within the distal femur.
