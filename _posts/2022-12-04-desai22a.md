title: 'VORTEX: Physics-Driven Data Augmentations Using Consistency Training for Robust
  Accelerated MRI Reconstruction'
abstract: Deep neural networks have enabled improved image quality and fast inference
  times for various inverse problems, including accelerated magnetic resonance imaging
  (MRI) reconstruction. However, such models require a large number of fully-sampled
  ground truth datasets, which are difficult to curate, and are sensitive to distribution
  drifts. In this work, we propose applying physics-driven data augmentations for
  consistency training that leverage our domain knowledge of the forward MRI data
  acquisition process and MRI physics to achieve improved label efficiency and robustness
  to clinically-relevant distribution drifts. Our approach, termed VORTEX, (1) demonstrates
  strong improvements over supervised baselines with and without data augmentation
  in robustness to signal-to-noise ratio change and motion corruption in data-limited
  regimes; (2) considerably outperforms state-of-the-art purely image-based data augmentation
  techniques and self-supervised reconstruction methods on both in-distribution and
  out-of-distribution data; and (3) enables composing heterogeneous image-based and
  physics-driven data augmentations.
