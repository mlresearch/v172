title: Explainable Weakly-Supervised Cell Segmentation by Canonical Shape Learning
  and Transformation
abstract: "Microscopy images have been increasingly analyzed quantitatively in biomedical
  research.\r Segmenting individual cell nucleus is an important step as many research
  studies involve counting cell nuclei and analysing their shape. We propose a novel
  weakly supervised instance segmentation method trained with image segmentation masks
  only. Our system comprises two models: an  implicit shape Multi-Layer Perceptron
  (MLP) that learns the shape of the nuclei in canonical coordinates; and 2) an encoder
  that predicts the parameters of the affine transformation to deform the canonical
  shape into the correct location, scale, and orientation in the image. To further
  improve the performance of the model, we propose a loss that uses the total number
  of nuclei in an image as supervision. Our system is explainable, as the implicit
  shape MLP learns that the canonical shape of the cell nuclei is a circle, and interpretable
  as the output of the encoder are parameters of affine transformations. We obtain
  image segmentation performance close to DeepLabV3 and, additionally, obtain an F1-score$_{IoU=0.5}$
  of $68.47%$ at the instance segmentation task, even though the system was trained
  with image segmentations."
