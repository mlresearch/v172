title: Learning Strategies for Contrast-agnostic Segmentation via SynthSeg for Infant
  MRI data
abstract: Longitudinal studies of infants’ brains are essential for research and clinical
  detection of neurodevelopmental disorders. However, for infant brain MRI scans,
  effective deep learning-based  segmentation frameworks exist only within small age
  intervals due to the large image intensity and contrast changes that take place
  in the early postnatal stages of development. However, using different segmentation
  frameworks or models at different age intervals within the same longitudinal data
  set would cause segmentation inconsistencies and age-specific biases. Thus, an age-agnostic
  segmentation model for infants’ brains is needed. In this paper, we present “Infant-SynthSeg“,
  an extension of the contrast-agnostic SynthSeg segmentation framework applicable
  to MRI data of infants at ages within the first year of life. Our work mainly focuses
  on extending learning strategies related to synthetic data generation and augmentation,
  with the aim of creating a method that employs training data capturing features
  unique to infants’ brains during this early-stage development. Comparison across
  different learning strategy settings, as well as a more-traditional contrast-aware
  deep learning model (nnU-net) are presented. Our experiments show that our trained
  Infant-SynthSeg models show consistently high segmentation performance on MRI scans
  of infant brains throughout the first year of life. Furthermore, as the model is
  trained on ground truth labels at different ages, even labels that are not present
  at certain ages (such as cerebellar white matter at 1 month) can be appropriately
  segmented via Infant-SynthSeg across the whole age range. Finally, while Infant-SynthSeg
  shows consistent segmentation performance across the first year of life, it is outperformed
  by age-specific deep learning models trained for a specific narrow age range.
