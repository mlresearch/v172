title: Warmstart Approach for Accelerating Deep Image Prior Reconstruction in Dynamic
  Tomography
abstract: Deep image prior (DIP) has been successfully used in the field of tomography
  to obtain high-quality images from under-sampled and noisy measurements. The key
  advantage of DIP compared to conventional deep-learning based image reconstruction
  techniques is that it requires no training data and thus can be used in a flexible
  manner without incorporating domain specific knowledge. The downside of DIP is that
  it shifts the training step to reconstruction time where usually fast algorithms
  are required to reduced the latency between acquisition and display of the reconstructed
  image. In this work we tackle this problem for dynamic tomography scenarios in which
  a large number of temporally resolved images are taken over time. By initializing
  the DIP network using a previous frame of the time series, it is possible to significantly
  reduce the overall reconstruction time. To cope with abrupt changes in the captured
  time-series, we propose to use an adaptive restart method having the ability to
  switch between warm- and coldstart depending on the amount of inter-frame changes.
