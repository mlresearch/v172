title: Learned Half-Quadratic Splitting Network for MR Image Reconstruction
abstract: Magnetic Resonance (MR) image reconstruction from highly undersampled $k$-space
  data is critical in accelerated MR imaging (MRI) techniques. In recent years, deep
  learning-based methods have shown great potential in this task. This paper proposes
  a learned half-quadratic splitting algorithm for MR image reconstruction and implements
  the algorithm in an unrolled deep learning network architecture. We compare the
  performance of our proposed method on a public cardiac MR dataset against  DC-CNN,
  ISTANet$^+$ and LPDNet, and our method outperforms other methods in both quantitative
  results and qualitative results. Finally, we enlarge our model to achieve superior
  reconstruction quality, and the improvement is $1.00$ dB and $1.76$ dB over LPDNet
  in peak signal-to-noise ratio on $5\times$ and $10\times$ acceleration, respectively.
  Code for our method is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/hellopipu/HQS-Net.}
