title: 'AdwU-Net: Adaptive Depth and Width U-Net for Medical Image Segmentation by
  Differentiable Neural Architecture Search'
abstract: The U-Net and its variants are proved as the most successful architectures
  in the medical image segmentation domain. However, the optimal configuration of
  the hyperparameters in U-Net structure such as depth and width remain challenging
  to adjust manually due to the diversity of medical image segmentation tasks. In
  this paper, we propose AdwU-Net, which is an efficient neural architecture search
  framework to search the optimal task-specific depth and width in the U-Net backbone.
  Specifically, an adaptive depth and width block is designed and applied hierarchically
  in U-Net. In each block, the optimal number of convolutional layers and channels
  in each layer are directly learned from data. To reduce the computational costs
  and alleviate the memory pressure, we conduct an efficient architecture search and
  reuse the network weights of different depth and width options in a differentiable
  manner. Extensive experiments on the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) dataset
  show that our method outperforms not only the manually scaled U-Net but also other
  state-of-the-art architectures. Our code is publicly available at \href{https://github.com/Ziyan-Huang/AdwU-Net}{https://github.com/Ziyan-Huang/AdwU-Net}.
