title: Learning to Automatically Generate Accurate ECG Captions
abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is an affordable, non-invasive and quick method
  to gain essential information about the electrical activity of the heart. Interpreting
  ECGs is a time-consuming process even for experienced cardiologists, which motivates
  the current usage of rule-based methods in clinical practice to automatically describe
  ECGs. However, in comparison with descriptions created by experts, ECG-descriptions
  generated by such rule-based methods show considerable limitations. Inspired by
  image captioning methods, we instead propose a data-driven approach for ECG description
  generation. We introduce a label-guided Transformer model, and show that it is possible
  to automatically generate relevant and readable ECG descriptions with a data-driven
  captioning model. We incorporate prior ECG labels into our model design, and show
  this improves the overall quality of generated descriptions. We find that training
  these models on free-text annotations of ECGs - instead of the clinically-used computer
  generated ECG descriptions - greatly improves performance. Moreover, we perform
  a human expert evaluation study of our best system, which shows that our data-driven
  approach improves upon existing rule-based methods.
