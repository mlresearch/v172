title: Single Dynamic Network for Multi-label Renal Pathology Image Segmentation
abstract: Computer-assisted quantitative analysis on Giga-pixel pathology images has
  provided a new avenue in histology examination. The innovations have been largely
  focused on cancer pathology (i.e., tumor segmentation and characterization). In
  non-cancer pathology, the learning algorithms can be asked to examine more comprehensive
  tissue types simultaneously, as a multi-label setting. The prior arts typically
  needed to train multiple segmentation networks in order to match the domain-specific
  knowledge for heterogeneous tissue types (e.g., glomerular tuft, glomerular unit,
  proximal tubular, distal tubular, peritubular capillaries, and arteries). In this
  paper, we propose a dynamic single segmentation network (Omni-Seg) that learns to
  segment multiple tissue types using partially labeled images (i.e., only one tissue
  type is labeled for each training image) for renal pathology.  By learning from
   150,000 patch-wise pathological images from six tissue types, the proposed Omni-Seg
  network achieved superior segmentation accuracy and less resource consumption when
  compared to the previous the multiple-network and multi-head design. In the testing
  stage, the proposed method obtains “completely labeled" tissue segmentation results
  using only “partially labeled" training images. The source code is available at  \url{https://github.com/ddrrnn123/Omni-Seg}
