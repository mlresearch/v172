title: Are 2.5D approaches superior to 3D deep networks in whole brain segmentation?
abstract: Segmentation of 3D volumes with a large number of labels, small convoluted
  structures, and lack of contrast between various structural boundaries is a difficult
  task. While recent methodological advances across many segmentation tasks are dominated
  by 3D architectures, currently the strongest performing method for whole brain segmentation
  is FastSurferCNN, a 2.5D approach. To shed light on the nuanced differences between
  2.5D and various 3D approaches, we perform a thorough and fair comparison and suggest
  a spatially-ensembled 3D architecture. Interestingly, we observe training memory
  intensive 3D segmentation on full-view images does not outperform the 2.5D approach.
  A shift to training on patches even while evaluating on full-view solves these limitations
  of both memory and performance limitations at the same time. We demonstrate significant
  performance improvements over state-of-the-art 3D methods on both Dice Similarity
  Coefficient and especially average Hausdorff Distance measures across five datasets.
  Finally, our validation across variations of neurodegenerative disease states and
  scanner manufacturers, shows we outperform the previously leading 2.5D approach
  FastSurferCNN demonstrating robust segmentation performance in realistic settings.
