title: Angular Super-Resolution in Diffusion MRI with a 3D Recurrent Convolutional
  Autoencoder
abstract: High resolution diffusion MRI (dMRI) data is often constrained by limited
  scanning time in clinical settings, thus restricting the use of downstream analysis
  techniques that would otherwise be available. In this work we develop a 3D recurrent
  convolutional neural network (RCNN) capable of super-resolving dMRI volumes in the
  angular (q-space) domain. Our approach formulates the task of angular super-resolution
  as a patch-wise regression using a 3D autoencoder conditioned on target b-vectors.
  Within the network we use a convolutional long short term memory (ConvLSTM) cell
  to model the relationship between q-space samples. We compare model performance
  against a baseline spherical harmonic interpolation and a 1D variant of the model
  architecture. We show that the 3D model has the lowest error rates across different
  subsampling schemes and b-values. The relative performance of the 3D RCNN is greatest
  in the very low angular resolution domain. Code for this project is available at
  github.com/m-lyon/dMRI-RCNN.
