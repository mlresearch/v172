title: Hierarchical Optimal Transport for Comparing Histopathology Datasets
abstract: Scarcity of labeled histopathology data limits the applicability of deep
  learning methods to under-profiled cancer types and labels. Transfer learning allows
  researchers to overcome the limitations of small datasets by pre-training machine
  learning models on larger datasets \emph{similar} to the small target dataset. However,
  similarity between datasets is often determined heuristically. In this paper, we
  propose a principled notion of distance between histopathology datasets based on
  a hierarchical generalization of optimal transport distances. Our method does not
  require any training, is agnostic to model type, and preserves much of the hierarchical
  structure in histopathology datasets imposed by tiling. We apply our method to H&E
  stained slides from The Cancer Genome Atlas from six different cancer types. We
  show that our method outperforms a baseline distance in a cancer-type prediction
  task. Our results also show that our optimal transport distance predicts difficulty
  of transferability in a tumor vs.Â normal prediction setting.
