title: 'Automatic Segmentation of Head and Neck Tumor: How Powerful Transformers Are?'
abstract: Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and head and neck
  (H&N) cancer is amongst the most prevalent types. Positron emission tomography and
  computed tomography are used to detect, segment and quantify the tumor region. Clinically,
  tumor segmentation is extensively time-consuming and prone to error. Machine learning,
  and deep learning in particular, can assist to automate this process, yielding results
  as accurate as the results of a clinician. In this paper, we investigate a vision
  transformer-based method to automatically delineate H&N tumor, and compare its results
  to leading convolutional neural network (CNN)-based models. We use multi-modal data
  from CT and PET scans to perform the segmentation task. We show that a solution
  with a transformer-based model has the potential to achieve comparable results to
  CNN-based ones. With cross validation, the model achieves a mean dice similarity
  coefficient (DSC) of 0.736, mean precision of 0.766 and mean recall of 0.766. This
  is only 0.021 less than the 2020 competition winning model (cross validated in-house)
  in terms of the DSC score. On the testing set, the model performs similarly, with
  DSC of 0.736, precision of 0.773, and recall of 0.760, which is only 0.023 lower
  in DSC than the 2020 competition winning model. This work shows that cancer segmentation
  via transformer-based models is a promising research area to further explore.
