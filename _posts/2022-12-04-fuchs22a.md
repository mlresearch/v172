title: Practical uncertainty quantification for brain tumor segmentation
abstract: Despite U-Nets being the de-facto standard for medical image segmentation,
  researchers have identified shortcomings of U-Nets, such as overconfidence and poor
  out-of-distribution generalization. Several methods for uncertainty quantification
  try to solve such problems by relying on well-known approximations such as Monte-Carlo
  Drop-Out, Probabilistic U-Net, and Stochastic Segmentation Networks. We introduce
  a novel multi-headed Variational U-Net. The proposed approach combines the global
  exploration capabilities of deep ensembles with the out-of-distribution robustness
  of Variational Inference. An efficient training strategy and an expressive yet general
  design ensure superior uncertainty quantification within a reasonable compute requirement.
  We thoroughly analyze the performance and properties of our approach on the publicly
  available BRATS2018 dataset. Further, we test our model on four commonly observed
  distribution shifts. The proposed approach has good uncertainty calibration and
  is robust to out-of-distribution shifts.
