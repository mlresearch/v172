title: 'Deep Learning Radiographic Assessment of Pulmonary Edema: Training with Serum
  Biomarkers'
abstract: 'A major obstacle faced when developing convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
  for medical imaging is the acquisition of training labels: most current approaches
  rely on manually prescribed labels from physicians, which are time consuming and
  labor intensive to attain. Clinical biomarkers, often measured alongside medical
  images and used in diagnostic workup, may provide a rich set of data that can be
  collected retrospectively and utilized to train diagnostic models. In this work,
  we focused on the blood serum biomarkers BNP and BNPP, indicative of acute heart
  failure (HF) and cardiogenic pulmonary edema, paired with the chest X-ray imaging
  modality. We investigated the potential for inferring BNP and BNPP from chest radiographs.
  For this purpose, a CNN was trained using \textcolor{black}{27748} radiographs to
  automatically infer BNP and BNPP, and achieved strong performance ($AUC=0.90$, \textcolor{black}{${SEN}=0.88$},
  \textcolor{black}{${SPEC}=0.81$}, $r=0.79$). Since radiographic features of pulmonary
  edema may not be visible on low resolution images, we also assessed the impact of
  image resolution on model learning and performance, comparing CNNs trained at five
  image sizes ($64\times64$ to $1024\times1024$). With comparable AUC values obtained
  at different resolutions, our experiments using three activation mapping techniques
  (saliency, Grad-CAM, XRAI) revealed considerable in-lung attention growth with increased
  resolution. The highest resolution models focus attention on the lungs, necessary
  for radiographic diagnosis of pulmonary edema. Our results emphasize the need to
  utilize radiographs of near-native resolution for optimal CNN performance, not fully
  captured by summary metrics like AUC.'
