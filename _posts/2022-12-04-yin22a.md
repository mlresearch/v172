title: Left Ventricle Contouring in Cardiac Images Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning
abstract: Assessment of the left ventricle segmentation in cardiac magnetic resonance
  imaging (MRI) is of crucial importance for cardiac disease diagnosis. However, conventional
  manual segmentation is a tedious task that requires excessive human effort, which
  makes automated segmentation highly desirable in practice to facilitate the process
  of clinical diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a novel reinforcement-learning-based
  framework for left ventricle contouring, which mimics how a cardiologist outlines
  the left ventricle along a specific trajectory in a cardiac image. Following the
  algorithm of proximal policy optimization (PPO), we train a policy network, which
  makes a stochastic decision on the agent’s movement according to its local observation
  such that the generated trajectory matches the true contour of the left ventricle
  as much as possible. Moreover, we design a deep learning model with a customized
  loss function to generate the agent’s landing spot (or coordinate of its initial
  position on a cardiac image). The experiment results show that the coordinate of
  the generated landing spot is sufficiently close to the true contour and the proposed
  reinforcement-learning-based approach outperforms the existing U-net model and its
  improved version, even with limited training set.
