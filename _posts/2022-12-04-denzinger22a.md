title: CAD-RADS Scoring using Deep Learning and Task-Specific Centerline Labeling
abstract: With coronary artery disease (CAD) persisting to be one of the leading causes
  of death worldwide, interest in supporting physicians with algorithms to speed up
  and improve diagnosis is high.  In clinical practice, the severeness of CAD is often
  assessed with a coronary CT angiography (CCTA) scan and manually graded with the
  CAD-Reporting and Data System (CAD-RADS) score.  The clinical questions this score
  assesses are whether patients have CAD or not (rule-out) and whether they have severe
  CAD or not (hold-out). In this work, we reach new state-of-the-art performance for
  automatic CAD-RADS scoring. We propose using severity-based label encoding, test
  time augmentation (TTA) and model ensembling for a task-specific deep learning architecture.
  Furthermore, we introduce a novel task- and model-specific, heuristic coronary segment
  labeling, which subdivides coronary trees into consistent parts across patients.
  It is fast, robust, and easy to implement. We were able to raise the previously
  reported area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) from 0.914
  to \textbf{0.942} in the rule-out and from 0.921 to \textbf{0.950} in the hold-out
  task respectively.
