title: Diffeomorphic Image Registration Using Lipschitz Continuous Residual Networks
abstract: Image registration is an essential task in medical image analysis. We propose
  two novel unsupervised diffeomorphic image registration networks, which use deep
  Residual Networks (ResNets) as numerical approximations of the underlying continuous
  diffeomorphic setting governed by ordinary differential equations (ODEs), viewed
  as an Eulerian discretization scheme. While considering the ODE-based parameterizations
  of diffeomorphisms, we consider both stationary and non-stationary (time varying)
  velocity fields as the driving velocities to solve the ODEs, which gives rise to
  our two proposed architectures for diffeomorphic registration. We also employ Lipschitz-continuity
  on the Residual Networks in both architectures to define the admissible Hilbert
  space of velocity fields as a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS) and regularize
  the smoothness of the velocity fields. We apply both registration networks to align
  and segment the OASIS brain MRI dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our
  models are computation efficient and achieve comparable registration results with
  a smoother deformation field.
