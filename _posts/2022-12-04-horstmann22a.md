title: Orientation Estimation of Abdominal Ultrasound Images with Multi-Hypotheses
  Networks
abstract: Ultrasound imaging can provide valuable information to clinicians during
  interventions, in particular when fused with other modalities. Multi-modal image
  registration algorithms however require a somewhat accurate initialization, which
  is particularly difficult to estimate for ultrasound images as their orientation
  is arbitrary and their content ambiguous (limited field of view, artifacts, etc.).
  In this work, we not only train neural networks to predict the absolute orientation
  of ultrasound frames, but also to produce a confidence for each prediction. This
  allows us to select only the most confident frames in the clip. Our networks are
  trained to produce multiple hypotheses using a simple yet overlooked meta-loss that
  is specifically designed to capture the ambiguity of the input data. We show on
  several abdominal ultrasound datasets that multi-hypotheses networks provide better
  uncertainty estimates than Monte-Carlo dropout while being more efficient than network
  ensembling. Generic, easy to implement and able to quantify both data ambiguity
  and out-of-distribution samples, they represent a preferable alternative to traditional
  baselines for uncertainty estimation. On a clinical test our method produces estimates
  within $20^{\circ}$ of the true orientation, which we can use to improve the accuracy
  of a subsequent registration algorithm down to less than $10^{\circ}$.
