title: Memory-efficient Segmentation of High-resolution Volumetric MicroCT Images
abstract: In recent years, 3D convolutional neural networks have become the dominant
  approach for volumetric medical image segmentation. However, compared to their 2D
  counterparts, 3D networks introduce substantially more training parameters and higher
  requirement for the GPU memory. This has become a major limiting factor for designing
  and training 3D networks for high-resolution volumetric images. In this work, we
  propose a novel memory-efficient network architecture for 3D high-resolution image
  segmentation. The network incorporates both global and local features via a two-stage
  U-net-based cascaded framework and at the first stage, a memory-efficient U-net
  (meU-net) is developed. The features learnt at the two stages are connected via
  post-concatenation, which further improves the information flow. The proposed segmentation
  method is evaluated on an ultra high-resolution microCT dataset with typically 250
  million voxels per volume. Experiments show that it outperforms state-of-the-art
  3D segmentation methods in terms of both segmentation accuracy and memory efficiency.
