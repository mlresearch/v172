title: MR Image Super Resolution By Combining Feature Disentanglement CNNs and Vision
  Transformers
abstract: State of the art magnetic resonance (MR) image super-resolution methods
  (ISR) using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) leverage limited contextual information
  due to the limited spatial coverage of CNNs. Vision transformers (ViT) learn better
  global context that is helpful in generating superior quality HR images. We combine
  local information of CNNs and global information from ViTs for image super resolution
  and output super resolved images that have superior quality than those produced
  by state of the art methods. We include  extra constraints through multiple novel
  loss functions that preserve structure and texture information from the low resolution
  to high resolution images.
