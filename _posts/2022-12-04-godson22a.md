title: Weakly-supervised learning for image-based classification of primary melanomas
  into genomic immune subgroups
abstract: Determining early-stage prognostic markers and stratifying patients for
  effective treatment are two key challenges for improving outcomes for melanoma patients.
  Previous studies have used tumour transcriptome data to stratify patients into immune
  subgroups, which were associated with differential melanoma specific survival and
  potential treatment strategies. However, acquiring transcriptome data is a time-consuming
  and costly process. Moreover, it is not routinely used in the current clinical workflow.
  Here we attempt to overcome this by developing deep learning models to classify
  gigapixel H&E stained pathology slides, which are well established in clinical workflows,
  into these immune subgroups. Previous subtyping approaches have employed supervised
  learning which requires fully annotated data, or have only examined single genetic
  mutations in melanoma patients. We leverage a multiple-instance learning approach,
  which only requires slide-level labels and uses an attention mechanism to highlight
  regions of high importance to the classification. Moreover, we show that pathology-specific
  self-supervised models generate better representations compared to pathology-agnostic
  models for improving our model performance, achieving a mean AUC of 0.76 for classifying
  histopathology images as high or low immune subgroups. We anticipate that this method
  may allow us to find new biomarkers of high importance and could act as a tool for
  clinicians to infer the immune landscape of tumours and stratify patients, without
  needing to carry out additional expensive genetic tests.
