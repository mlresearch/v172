title: Survival Analysis for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis using CT Images and Incomplete
  Clinical Data
abstract: Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is an inexorably progressive fibrotic
  lung disease with a variable and unpredictable rate of progression. CT scans of
  the lungs inform clinical assessment of IPF patients and contain pertinent information
  related to disease progression. In this work, we propose a multi-modal method that
  uses neural networks and memory banks to predict the survival of IPF patients using
  clinical and imaging data. The majority of clinical IPF patient records have missing
  data (e.g. missing lung function tests). To this end, we propose a probabilistic
  model that captures the dependencies between the observed clinical variables and
  imputes missing ones. This principled approach to missing data imputation can be
  naturally combined with a deep survival analysis model. We show that the proposed
  framework yields significantly better survival analysis results than baselines in
  terms of concordance index and integrated Brier score. Our work also provides insights
  into novel image-based biomarkers that are linked to mortality.
