title: 'SMU-Net: Style matching U-Net for brain tumor segmentation with missing modalities'
abstract: Gliomas are one of the most prevalent types of primary brain tumors, accounting
  for more than 30% of all cases and they develop from the glial stem or progenitor
  cells. In theory, the majority of brain tumors could well be identified exclusively
  by the use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Each MRI modality delivers distinct
  information on the soft tissue of the human brain and integrating all of them would
  provide comprehensive data for the accurate segmentation of the glioma, which is
  crucial for the patientâ€™s prognosis, diagnosis, and determining the best follow-up
  treatment. Unfortunately, MRI is prone to artifacts for a variety of reasons, which
  might result in missing one or more MRI modalities. Various strategies have been
  proposed over the years to synthesize the missing modality or compensate for the
  influence it has on automated segmentation models. However, these methods usually
  fail to model the underlying missing information. In this paper, we propose a style
  matching U-Net (SMU-Net) for brain tumour segmentation on MRI images. Our co-training
  approach utilizes a content and style-matching mechanism to distill the informative
  features from the full-modality network into a missing modality network. To do so,
  we encode both full-modality and missing-modality data into a latent space, then
  we decompose the representation space into a style and content representation.  Our
  style matching module adaptively recalibrates the representation space by learning
  a matching function to transfer the informative and textural features from full-modality
  path into a missing-modality path. Moreover, by modelling the mutual information,
  our content module surpasses the less informative features and re-calibrates the
  representation space based on discriminative semantic features. The evaluation process
  on the BraTS 2018 dataset shows the significance of the proposed method on the missing
  modality scenario.
