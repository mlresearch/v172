title: Efficient tool segmentation for endoscopic videos in the wild
abstract: 'In recent years, deep learning methods have become the most effective approach
  for tool segmentation in endoscopic images, achieving the state of the art on the
  available public benchmarks. However, these methods present some challenges that
  hinder their direct deployment in real world scenarios. This work explores how to
  solve two of the most common challenges: real-time and memory restrictions and false
  positives in frames with no tools. To cope with the first case, we show how to adapt
  an efficient general purpose semantic segmentation model. Then, we study how to
  cope with the common issue of only training on images with at least one tool. Then,
  when images of endoscopic procedures without tools are processed, there are a lot
  of false positives. To solve this, we propose to add an extra classification head
  that performs binary frame classification, to identify frames with no tools present.
  Finally, we present a thorough comparison of this approach with current state of
  the art on different benchmarks, including real medical practice recordings, demonstrating
  similar accuracy with much lower computational requirements.'
