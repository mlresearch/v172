title: Transformer-based out-of-distribution detection for clinically safe segmentation
abstract: In a clinical setting it is essential that deployed image processing systems
  are robust to the full range of inputs they might encounter and, in particular,
  do not make confidently wrong predictions. The most popular approach to safe processing
  is to train networks that can provide a measure of their uncertainty, but these
  tend to fail for inputs that are far outside the training data distribution. Recently,
  generative modelling approaches have been proposed as an alternative; these can
  quantify the likelihood of a data sample explicitly, filtering out any out-of-distribution
  (OOD) samples before further processing is performed. In this work, we focus on
  image segmentation and evaluate several approaches to network uncertainty in the
  far-OOD and near-OOD cases for the task of segmenting haemorrhages in head CTs.
  We find all of these approaches are unsuitable for safe segmentation as they provide
  confidently wrong predictions when operating OOD. We propose performing full 3D
  OOD detection using a VQ-GAN to provide a compressed latent representation of the
  image and a transformer to estimate the data likelihood. Our approach successfully
  identifies images in both the far- and near-OOD cases. We find a strong relationship
  between image likelihood and the quality of a modelâ€™s segmentation, making this
  approach viable for filtering images unsuitable for segmentation. To our knowledge,
  this is the first time transformers have been applied to perform OOD detection on
  3D image data.
