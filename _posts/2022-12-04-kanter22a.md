title: A Flexible Meta Learning Model for Image Registration
abstract: We propose a trainable architecture for affine image registration to produce
  robust starting points for conventional image registration methods. Learning-based
  methods for image registration often require networks with many parameters and heavily
  engineered cost functions and thus are complex and computationally expensive. Despite
  their success in recent years, these methods often lack the accuracy of classical
  iterative image registration and struggle with large deformations. On the other
  hand, iterative methods depend on good initial estimates and tuned hyperparameters.
  We tackle this problem by combining effective shallow networks and classical optimization
  algorithms using strategies from the field of meta-learning. The architecture presented
  in this work incorporates only first-order gradient information of the given registration
  problems, making it highly flexible and particularly well-suited as an initialization
  step for classical image registration.
