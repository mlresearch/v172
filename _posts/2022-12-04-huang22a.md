title: 'Breathing Freely: Self-supervised Liver T1rho Mapping from A Single T1rho-weighted
  Image'
abstract: Quantitative T1rho imaging is a promising technique for assessment of chronic
  liver disease. The standard approach requires acquisition of multiple T1rho-weighted
  images of the liver to quantify T1rho relaxation time. The quantification accuracy
  can be affected by respiratory motion if the subjects cannot hold the breath during
  the scan. To tackle this problem, we propose a self-supervised mapping method by
  taking only one T1rho-weighted image to do the mapping. Our method takes into account
  of signal scale variations in MR scan when performing T1rho quantification. Preliminary
  experimental results show that our method can achieve better mapping performance
  than the traditional fitting method, particularly in free-breathing scenarios.
