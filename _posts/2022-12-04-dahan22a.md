title: 'Surface Vision Transformers: Attention-Based Modelling applied to Cortical
  Analysis'
abstract: The extension of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to non-Euclidean geometries
  has led to multiple frameworks for studying manifolds. Many of those methods have
  shown design limitations resulting in poor modelling of long-range associations,
  as the generalisation of convolutions to irregular surfaces is non-trivial. Motivated
  by the success of attention-modelling in computer vision, we translate  convolution-free
  vision transformer approaches to surface data, to introduce a domain-agnostic architecture
  to study any surface data projected onto a spherical manifold. Here, surface patching
  is achieved by representing spherical data as a sequence of triangular patches,
  extracted from a subdivided icosphere. A transformer model encodes the sequence
  of patches via successive multi-head self-attention layers while preserving the
  sequence resolution. We validate the performance of the proposed Surface Vision
  Transformer (<em>SiT</em>) on the task of phenotype regression from cortical surface
  metrics derived from the Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP). Experiments
  show that the <em>SiT</em> generally outperforms surface CNNs, while performing
  comparably on registered and unregistered data. Analysis of transformer attention
  maps offers strong potential to characterise subtle cognitive developmental patterns.
