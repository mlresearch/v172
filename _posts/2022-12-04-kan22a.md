title: 'FBNETGEN: Task-aware GNN-based fMRI Analysis via Functional Brain Network
  Generation'
abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is one of the most common imaging
  modalities to investigate brain functions. Recent studies in neuroscience stress
  the great potential of functional brain networks constructed from fMRI data for
  clinical predictions. Traditional functional brain networks, however, are noisy
  and unaware of downstream prediction tasks, while also incompatible with the deep
  graph neural network (GNN) models. In order to fully unleash the power of GNNs in
  network-based fMRI analysis, we develop FBNETGEN, a task-aware and interpretable
  fMRI analysis framework via deep brain network generation. In particular, we formulate
  (1) prominent region of interest (ROI) features extraction, (2) brain networks generation,
  and (3) clinical predictions with GNNs, in an end-to-end trainable model under the
  guidance of particular prediction tasks. Along with the process, the key novel component
  is the graph generator which learns to transform raw time-series features into task-oriented
  brain networks. Our learnable graphs also provide unique interpretations by highlighting
  prediction-related brain regions. Comprehensive experiments on two datasets, i.e.,
  the recently released and currently largest publicly available fMRI dataset Adolescent
  Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD), and the widely-used fMRI dataset PNC, prove
  the superior effectiveness and interpretability of FBNETGEN. The implementation
  is available at https://github.com/Wayfear/FBNETGEN.
