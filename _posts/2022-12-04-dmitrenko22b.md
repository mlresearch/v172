title: Self-supervised learning for analysis of temporal and morphological drug effects
  in cancer cell imaging data
abstract: In this work, we propose two novel methodologies to study temporal and morphological
  phenotypic effects caused by different experimental conditions using imaging data.
  As a proof of concept, we apply them to analyze drug effects in 2D cancer cell cultures.
  We train a convolutional autoencoder on 1M images dataset with random augmentations
  and multi-crops to use as feature extractor. We systematically compare it to the
  pretrained state-of-the-art models. We further use the feature extractor in two
  ways. First, we apply distance-based analysis and dynamic time warping to cluster
  temporal patterns of 31 drugs. We identify clusters allowing annotation of drugs
  as having cytotoxic, cytostatic, mixed or no effect. Second, we implement an adversarial/regularized
  learning setup to improve classification of 31 drugs and visualize image regions
  that contribute to the improvement. We increase top-3 classification accuracy by
  8% on average and mine examples of morphological feature importance maps. We provide
  the feature extractor and the weights to foster transfer learning applications in
  biology. We also discuss utility of other pretrained models and applicability of
  our methods to other types of biomedical data.
