title: 'KeyMorph: Robust Multi-modal Affine Registration via Unsupervised Keypoint
  Detection'
abstract: 'Registration is a fundamental task in medical imaging, and recent machine
  learning methods have become the state-of-the-art. However, these approaches are
  often not interpretable, lack robustness to large misalignments, and do not incorporate
  symmetries of the problem. In this work, we propose KeyMorph, an unsupervised end-to-end
  learning-based image registration framework that relies on automatically detecting
  corresponding keypoints. Our core insight is straightforward: matching keypoints
  between images can be used to obtain the optimal transformation via a differentiable
  closed-form expression. We use this observation to drive the unsupervised learning
  of anatomically-consistent keypoints from images. This not only leads to substantially
  more robust registration but also yields better interpretability, since the keypoints
  reveal which parts of the image are driving the final alignment. Moreover, KeyMorph
  can be designed to be equivariant under image translations and symmetric with respect
  to the input image ordering. We demonstrate the proposed framework in solving 3D
  affine registration of multi-modal brain MRI scans. Remarkably, we show that this
  strategy leads to consistent keypoints, even across modalities. We demonstrate registration
  accuracy that surpasses current state-of-the-art methods, especially in the context
  of large displacements.'
