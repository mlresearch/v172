title: Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation via Cross Teaching between CNN and
  Transformer
abstract: 'Recently, deep learning with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers
  has shown encouraging results in fully supervised medical image segmentation. However,
  it is still challenging for them to achieve good performance with limited annotations
  for training. This work presents a very simple yet efficient framework for semi-supervised
  medical image segmentation by introducing the cross teaching between CNN and Transformer.
  Specifically, we simplify the classical deep co-training from consistency regularization
  to cross teaching, where the prediction of a network is used as the pseudo label
  to supervise the other network directly end-to-end. Considering the difference in
  learning paradigm between CNN and Transformer, we introduce the Cross Teaching between
  CNN and Transformer rather than just using CNNs. Experiments on a public benchmark
  show that our method outperforms eight existing semi-supervised learning methods
  just with a more straight-forward framework. Notably, this work may be the first
  attempt to combine CNN and transformer for semi-supervised medical image segmentation
  and achieve promising results on a public benchmark. Code is available at: https://github.com/HiLab-git/SSL4MIS.'
