title: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Medical Image Segmentation via Self-Training
  of Early Features
abstract: U-Net models provide a state-of-the-art approach for medical image segmentation,
  but their accuracy is often reduced when training and test images come from different
  domains, such as different scanners. Recent work suggests that, when limited supervision
  is available for domain adaptation, early U-Net layers benefit the most from a refinement.
  This motivates our proposed approach for self-supervised refinement, which does
  not require any manual annotations, but instead refines early layers based on the
  richer, higher-level information that is derived in later layers of the U-Net. This
  is achieved by adding a segmentation head for early features, and using the final
  predictions of the network as pseudo-labels for refinement. This strategy reduces
  detrimental effects of imperfection in the pseudo-labels, which are unavoidable
  given the domain shift, by retaining their probabilistic nature and restricting
  the refinement to early layers. Experiments on two medical image segmentation tasks
  confirm the effectiveness of this approach, even in a one-shot setting, and compare
  favorably to a baseline method for unsupervised domain adaptation.
