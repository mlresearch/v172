title: 'Video-based Computer-aided Laparoscopic Bleeding Management: a Space-time
  Memory Neural Network with Positional Encoding and Adversarial Domain Adaptation'
abstract: One of the main challenges in laparoscopic procedures is handling intraoperative
  bleeding. We propose video-based Computer-aided Laparoscopic Bleeding Management
  (CALBM) for early detection and management of intraoperative bleeding. Our system
  performs the online video-based segmentation of bleeding sources and displays them
  to the surgeon. It hinges on an improved space-time memory network, which we train
  from real and semi-synthetic data, using adversarial domain adaptation. Our system
  improves the IoU and F-Score from 69.97% to 73.40% and 50.23% to 58.09% in comparison
  to the baseline space-time memory network. It is far better than the prior CALBM
  systems based on still images, which we reimplemented with DeepLabV3+, reaching
  an  IoU and F-Score of 65.86% and 43.19%. The improvement is also supported by user
  evaluation.
