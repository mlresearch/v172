title: 'i3Deep: Efficient 3D interactive segmentation with the nnU-Net'
abstract: 3D interactive segmentation is highly relevant in reducing the annotation
  time for experts. However, current methods often achieve only small segmentation
  improvements per interaction as lightweight models are a requirement to ensure near-realtime
  usage. Models with better predictive performance such as the nnU-Net cannot be employed
  for interactive segmentation due to their high computational demands, which result
  in long inference times. To solve this issue, we propose the 3D interactive segmentation
  framework i3Deep. Slices are selected through uncertainty estimation in an offline
  setting and afterwards corrected by an expert. The slices are then fed to a refinement
  nnU-Net, which significantly improves the global 3D segmentation from the local
  corrections. This approach bypasses the issue of long inference times by moving
  expensive computations into an offline setting that does not include the expert.
  For three different anatomies, our approach reduces the workload of the expert by
  80.3%, while significantly improving the Dice by up to 39.5%, outperforming other
  state-of-the-art methods by a clear margin. Even on out-of-distribution data i3Deep
  is able to improve the segmentation by 19.3%.
