title: Explainability Guided COVID-19 Detection in CT Scans
abstract: 'Radiological examination of chest CT is an effective method for screening
  COVID-19 cases. In this work, we overcome three challenges in the automation of
  this process: (i) the limited number of supervised positive cases, (ii) the lack
  of region-based supervision, and (iii) variability across acquisition sites. These
  challenges are met by incorporating a recent augmentation solution called SnapMix,
  a novel explainability-driven contrastive loss for patch embedding, and by performing  test-time
  augmentation that masks out the most relevant patches in order to  analyse the prediction
  stability. The three techniques are complementary and are all based on utilizing
  the heatmaps produced by the Class Activation Mapping (CAM) explainability method.
  State-of-the-art performance is obtained on three different datasets for COVID detection
  in CT scans.'
