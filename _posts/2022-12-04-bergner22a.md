title: Interpretable and Interactive Deep Multiple Instance Learning for Dental Caries
  Classification in Bitewing X-rays
abstract: 'We propose a simple and efficient image classification architecture based
  on deep multiple instance learning, and apply it to the challenging task of caries
  detection in dental radiographs. Technically, our approach contributes in two ways:
  First, it outputs a heatmap of local patch classification probabilities despite
  being trained with weak image-level labels. Second, it is amenable to learning from
  segmentation labels to guide training. In contrast to existing methods, the human
  user can faithfully interpret predictions and interact with the model to decide
  which regions to attend to. Experiments are conducted on a large clinical dataset
  of 38k bitewings (316k teeth), where we achieve competitive performance compared
  to various baselines. When guided by an external caries segmentation model, a significant
  improvement in classification and localization performance is observed.'
