title: Self-Supervised Transformers for fMRI representation
abstract: We present TFF, which is a Transformer framework for the analysis of functional
  Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data. TFF employs a two-phase training approach.
  First, self-supervised training is applied to a collection of fMRI scans, where
  the model is trained to reconstruct 3D volume data. Second, the pre-trained model
  is fine-tuned on specific tasks, utilizing ground truth labels. Our results show
  state-of-the-art performance on a variety of fMRI tasks, including age and gender
  prediction, as well as schizophrenia recognition. Our code for the training, network
  architecture, and results is attached as supplementary material.
