title: Improving Explainability of Disentangled Representations using Multipath-Attribution
  Mappings
abstract: Explainable AI aims to render model behavior understandable by humans, which
  can be seen as an intermediate step in extracting causal relations from correlative
  patterns. Due to the high risk of possible fatal decisions in image-based clinical
  diagnostics, it is necessary to integrate explainable AI into these safety-critical
  systems. Current explanatory methods typically assign attribution scores to pixel
  regions in the input image, indicating their importance for a model’s decision.
  However, they fall short when explaining why a visual feature is used. We propose
  a framework that utilizes interpretable disentangled representations for downstream-task
  prediction. Through visualizing the disentangled representations, we enable experts
  to investigate possible causation effects by leveraging their domain knowledge.
  Additionally, we deploy a multi-path attribution mapping for enriching and validating
  explanations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a synthetic benchmark
  suite and two medical datasets. We show that the framework not only acts as a catalyst
  for causal relation extraction but also enhances model robustness by enabling shortcut
  detection without the need for testing under distribution shifts. Code available
