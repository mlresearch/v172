title: Differentiable Boundary Point Extraction for Weakly Supervised Star-shaped
  Object Segmentation
abstract: Domain adaptation has the potential to overcome the expensive or even infeasible
  labeling of target data by transferring knowledge from a labeled source domain.
  In this work, we address domain adaptation in the context of point cloud-based 3D
  human pose estimation, whose clinical applicability is severely limited by a lack
  of labeled training data. Unlike the mainstream approach of domain-invariant feature
  learning, we propose to guide the learning process in the target domain through
  weak supervision, based on prior knowledge about human anatomy. We embed this prior
  knowledge into a novel loss function that encourages network predictions to match
  the statistics of an anatomically plausible skeleton. Specifically, we formulate
  three loss functions that penalize asymmetric limb lengths, implausible joint angles,
  and implausible bone lengths. We evaluate the method on a public lying pose dataset
  (SLP), adapting from uncovered patients in the source to covered patients in the
  target domain. Our method outperforms diverse state-of-the-art domain adaptation
  techniques and improves the baseline model by 26% while reducing the gap to a fully
  supervised model by 54%. Source code is available at https://github.com/multimodallearning/da-3dhpe-anatomy.
