title: Differentiable Boundary Point Extraction for Weakly Supervised Star-shaped
  Object Segmentation
abstract: Although Deep Learning is the new gold standard in medical image segmentation,
the annotation burden limits its expansion to clinical practice. We also observe a mismatch between
annotations required by deep learning methods designed with pixel-wise optimization in
mind and clinically relevant annotations designed for biomarkers extraction (diameters,
counts, etc.). Our study proposes a first step toward bridging this gap, optimizing vessel
segmentation based on its diameter annotations. To do so we propose to extract bound-
ary points from a star-shaped segmentation in a differentiable manner. This differentiable
extraction allows reducing annotation burden as instead of the pixel-wise segmentation
only the two annotated points required for diameter measurement are used for training
the model. Our experiments show that training based on diameter is efficient; produces
state-of-the-art weakly supervised segmentation; and performs reasonably compared to full
supervision.
