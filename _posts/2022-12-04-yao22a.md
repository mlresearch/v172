title: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation through Shape Modeling for Medical Image Segmentation
abstract: Shape information is a strong and valuable prior in segmenting organs in
  medical images. However, most current deep learning based segmentation algorithms
  have not taken shape information into consideration, which can lead to bias towards
  texture. We aim at modeling shape explicitly and using it to help medical image
  segmentation. Previous methods proposed Variational Autoencoder (VAE) based models
  to learn the distribution of shape for a particular organ and used it to automatically
  evaluate the quality of a segmentation prediction by fitting it into the learned
  shape distribution. Based on which we aim at incorporating VAE into current segmentation
  pipelines. Specifically, we propose a new unsupervised domain adaptation pipeline
  based on a pseudo loss and a VAE reconstruction loss under a teacher-student learning
  paradigm. Both losses are optimized simultaneously and, in return, boost the segmentation
  task performance. Extensive experiments on three public Pancreas segmentation datasets
  as well as two in-house Pancreas segmentation datasets show consistent improvements
  with at least 2.8 points gain in the Dice score, demonstrating the effectiveness
  of our method in challenging unsupervised domain adaptation scenarios for medical
  image segmentation. We hope this work will advance shape analysis and geometric
  learning in medical imaging.
