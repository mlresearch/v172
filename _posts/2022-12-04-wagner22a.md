title: 'EfficientCellSeg: Efficient Volumetric Cell Segmentation Using Context Aware
  Pseudocoloring'
abstract: 'Volumetric cell segmentation in fluorescence microscopy images is important
  to study a wide variety of cellular processes. Applications range from the analysis
  of cancer cells to behavioral studies of cells in the embryonic stage. Like in other
  computer vision fields, most recent methods use either large convolutional neural
  networks (CNNs) or vision transformer models (ViTs). Since the number of available
  3D microscopy images is typically limited in applications, we take a different approach
  and introduce a small CNN for volumetric cell segmentation. Compared to previous
  CNN models for cell segmentation, our model is efficient and has an asymmetric encoder-decoder
  structure with very few parameters in the decoder. Training efficiency is further
  improved via transfer learning. In addition, we introduce Context Aware Pseudocoloring
  to exploit spatial context in z-direction of 3D images while performing volumetric
  cell segmentation slice-wise. We evaluated our method using different 3D datasets
  from the Cell Segmentation Benchmark of the Cell Tracking Challenge. Our segmentation
  method achieves top-ranking results, while our CNN model has an up to 25x lower
  number of parameters than other top-ranking methods. Code and pretrained models
  are available at: https://github.com/roydenwa/efficient-cell-seg.'
