title: Domain Generalization for Retinal Vessel Segmentation with Vector Field Transformer
abstract: Domain generalization has great impact on medical image analysis as data
  distribution inconsistencies are prevalent in most of the medical data modalities
  due to the image acquisition techniques. In this study, we investigate a novel pipeline
  that generalizes the retinal vessel segmentation across color fundus photography
  and OCT angiography images. We hypothesize that the scaled minor eigenvector of
  the Hessian matrix can sufficiently represent the vessel by vector flow. This vector
  field can be regarded as a common domain for different modalities as it is very
  similar even for data that follows vastly different intensity distributions. Next,
  we leverage the uncertainty in the latent space of the auto-encoder to synthesize
  enhanced vessel maps to augment the training data. Finally, we propose a transformer
  network to extract features from the vector field. We show the performance of our
  model in cross-modality experiments.
