title: Holistic Modeling In Medical Image Segmentation Using Spatial Recurrence
abstract: 'In clinical practice, regions of interest in medical imaging (MI) often
  need to be identified through a process of precise image segmentation. For MI segmentation
  to generalize, we need two components: to identify local descriptions, but at the
  same time to develop a holistic representation of the image that captures long-range
  spatial dependencies. Unfortunately, we demonstrate that the start of the art does
  not achieve the latter. In particular, it does not provide a modeling that yields
  a global, contextual model. To improve accuracy, and enable holistic modeling, we
  introduce a novel deep neural network architecture endowed with spatial recurrence.
  The implementation relies on gated recurrent units that directionally traverse the
  feature map, greatly increasing each layers receptive field and explicitly modeling
  non-adjacent relationships between pixels. Our method is evaluated in four different
  segmentation tasks: nuclei segmentation in microscopy images, colorectal polyp segmentation
  in colonoscopy videos, liver segmentation in abdominal CT scans, and aorta artery
  segmentation in thoracic CT scans. Our experiments demonstrate an average increase
  in performance of 4.72 Dice points and 0.68 Hausdorff distance units comparing to
  U-Net and U-Net++, and a performance better or on par when compared to transformer-based
  architectures. Code available at https://github.com/JoaoCarv/holistic-seg.'
