title: Structural Networks for Brain Age Prediction
abstract: Biological networks have gained considerable attention within the Deep Learning
  community because of the promising framework of Graph Neural Networks (GNN), neural
  models that operate in complex networks. In the context of neuroimaging, GNNs have
  successfully been employed for functional MRI processing but their application to
  ROI-level structural MRI (sMRI) remains mostly unexplored. In this work we analyze
  the implementation of these geometric models with sMRI by building graphs of ROIs
  (ROI graphs) using tools from Graph Signal Processing literature and evaluate their
  performance in a downstream supervised task, age prediction. We first make a qualitative
  and quantitative comparison of the resulting networks obtained with common graph
  topology learning strategies. In a second stage, we train GNN-based models for brain
  age prediction. Since the order of every ROI graph is exactly the same and each
  vertex is an entity by itself (a ROI), we evaluate whether including ROI information
  during message-passing or global pooling operations is beneficial and compare the
  performance of GNNs against a Fully-Connected Neural Network baseline. The results
  show that ROI-level information is needed during the global pooling operation in
  order to achieve competitive results. However, no relevant improvement has been
  detected when it is incorporated during the message passing. These models achieve
  a MAE of 4.27 in hold-out test data, which is a performance very similar to the
  baseline, suggesting that the inductive bias included with the obtained graph connectivity
  is relevant and useful to reduce the dimensionality of the problem.
