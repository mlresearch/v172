title: Robust Multi-Organ Nucleus Segmentation Using a Locally Rotation Invariant
  Bispectral U-Net
abstract: Locally Rotation Invariant (LRI) operators have shown great potential to
  robustly identify biomedical textures where discriminative patterns appear at random
  positions and orientations. We build LRI operators through the local projection
  of the image on circular harmonics followed by the computation of the bispectrum,
  which is LRI by design. This formulation allows to avoid the discretization of the
  orientations and does not require any criterion to locally align the descriptors.
  This operator is used in a convolutional layer resulting in LRI Convolutional Neural
  Networks (LRI CNN). To evaluate the relevance of this approach, we use it to segment
  cellular nuclei in histopathological images. We compare the proposed bispectral
  LRI layer against a standard convolutional layer in a U-Net architecture. While
  they perform equally in terms of F-score, the LRI CNN provides more robust segmentation
  with respect to orientation, even when rotational data augmentation is used. This
  robustness is essential when the relevant pattern may vary in orientation, which
  is often the case in medical images.
