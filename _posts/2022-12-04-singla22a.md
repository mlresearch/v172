title: 'Speckle and Shadows: Ultrasound-specific Physics-based Data Augmentation for
  Kidney Segmentation'
abstract: 'Techniques for data augmentation are widely employed to avoid overfitting,
  improve generalizability and overcome data scarcity. This data-oriented approach
  frequently uses domain-agnostic approaches such as geometric transformations, colour
  space transformations, and generative adversarial networks. However, utilsing domain-specific
  characteristics in augmentations may result in additional invariances or improved
  robustness. We present several augmentation techniques for ultrasound: zoom, time-gain
  compensation, artificial shadowing, and speckle parameter maps. Zoom and time-gain
  compensation mimic traditional image quality parameters. For shadowing, we characterize
  acoustic shadows within abdominal ultrasound images and provide a method for incorporating
  artificial shadows into existing images. Finally, we transform B-mode ultrasound
  images into Nakagami-based speckle parameter maps to describe spatial structures
  that are not visible in conventional B-mode. The augmentations are evaluated by
  training a fully supervised network and a contrastive learning network for multi-class
  intra-organ semantic segmentation. Our preliminary results reflect the difficulties
  of creating augmentations as well as the limitations posed by acoustic shadowing.'
