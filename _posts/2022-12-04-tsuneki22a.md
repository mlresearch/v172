title: Inference of captions from histopathological patches
abstract: Computational histopathology has made significant strides in the past few
  years, slowly getting closer to clinical adoption. One area of benefit would be
  the automatic generation of diagnostic reports from H&E-stained whole slide images
  which would further increase the efficiency of the pathologistsâ€™ routine diagnostic
  workflows. In this study, we compiled a dataset (PatchGastricADC22) of histopathological
  captions of stomach adenocarcinoma endoscopic biopsy specimens, which we extracted
  from diagnostic reports and paired with patches extracted from the associated whole
  slide images. The dataset contains a variety of gastric adenocarcinoma subtypes.
  We trained a baseline attention-based model to predict the captions from features
  extracted from the patches and obtained promising results. We make the captioned
  dataset of 262K patches publicly available.
