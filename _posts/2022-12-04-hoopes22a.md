title: 'TopoFit: Rapid Reconstruction of Topologically-Correct Cortical Surfaces'
abstract: Mesh-based reconstruction of the cerebral cortex is a fundamental component
  in brain image analysis. Classical, iterative pipelines for cortical modeling are
  robust but often time-consuming, mostly due to expensive procedures that involve
  topology correction and spherical mapping. Recent attempts to address reconstruction
  with machine learning methods have accelerated some components in these pipelines,
  but these methods still require slow processing steps to enforce topological constraints
  that comply with known anatomical structure. In this work, we introduce a novel
  learning-based strategy, TopoFit, which rapidly fits a topologically-correct surface
  to the white-matter tissue boundary. We design a joint network, with image and graph
  convolutions, and an efficient symmetric distance loss to learn to predict accurate
  deformations that map a template mesh to subject-specific anatomy. This technique
  encompasses the work of current mesh correction, fine-tuning, and inflation processes
  and, as a result, offers a 150x faster solution to cortical surface reconstruction
  compared to traditional approaches. We demonstrate that TopoFit is 1.8x more accurate
  than the current state-of-the-art deep-learning strategy, and it is robust to common
  failure modes, such as white-matter tissue hypointensities.
