title: Confidence Histograms for Model Reliability Analysis and Temperature Calibration
abstract: 'Proper estimation of uncertainty may help the adoption of deep learning-based
  solutions in clinical practice, when measurements can take error bounds into account
  and out-of-distribution situations can be reliably detected. Therefore, a variety
  of approaches have been proposed already, with varying requirements and computational
  effort. Uncertainty estimation is complicated by the fact that typical neural networks
  are overly confident; this effect is particularly prominent with the Dice loss,
  which is commonly used for image segmentation. Therefore, various methods for model
  calibration have been proposed to reduce the discrepancy between classifier confidence
  and the observed accuracy. In this work, we focus on the simple calibration method
  of introducing a temperature parameter for the softmax operation. This approach
  is not only appealing because of its mathematical simplicity, it also appears to
  be well-suited for countering the main distortion of the classifier output confidence
  levels. Finally, it comes at literally zero extra cost, because the necessary multiplications
  can be integrated into the previous layerâ€™s weights after calibration, and a scalar
  temperature does not affect the classification at all. Our contributions are as
  follows: We thoroughly evaluate the confidence behavior of several models with different
  architectures, different numbers of output classes, different loss functions, and
  different segmentation tasks. In order to do so, we propose an efficient intermediate
  representation and some adaptations of reliability diagrams to semantic segmentation.
  We investigate different calibration measures and their optimal temperatures for
  these diverse models.'
