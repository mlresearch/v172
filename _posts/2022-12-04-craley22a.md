title: 'SZLoc: A Multi-resolution Architecture for Automated Epileptic Seizure Localization
  from Scalp EEG'
abstract: 'We propose an end-to-end deep learning framework for epileptic seizure
  localization from scalp electroencephalography (EEG). Our architecture, SZLoc, extracts
  multi-resolution information via local (single channel) and global (cross-channel)
  CNN encodings. These interconnected representations are fused using a transformer
  layer. Leveraging its multi-resolution outputs, SZLoc derives three clinically interpretable
  outputs: electrode-level seizure activity, seizure onset zone localization, and
  identification of the EEG signal intervals that contribute to the final localization.  From
  an optimization standpoint, we formulate a novel ensemble of loss functions to train
  SZLoc using inexact spatial and temporal labels of seizure onset.  In this manner,
  SZLoc automatically learns phenomena at finer resolutions than the training labels.
  We validate our SZLoc framework and training paradigm on a clinical EEG dataset
  of 34 focal epilepsy patients.  As compared to other deep learning baseline models,
  SZLoc achieves robust inter-patient seizure localization performance.  We also demonstrate
  generalization of SZLoc to a second cohort of 16 epilepsy patients with different
  seizure characteristics and recorded at a different site. Taken together, SZLoc
  extends beyond the traditional paradigm of seizure detection by providing clinically
  relevant seizure localization information from coarse and inexact training labels.'
