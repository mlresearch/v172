title: An Analysis of the Impact of Annotation Errors on the Accuracy of Deep Learning
  for Cell Segmentation
abstract: 'Recent studies have shown that there can be high inter- and intra-observer
  variability when creating annotations for biomedical image segmentation. To mitigate
  the effects of manual annotation variability when training machine learning algorithms,
  various methods have been developed. However, little work has been done on actually
  assessing the impact of annotation errors on machine learning-based segmentation.
  For the task of cell segmentation, our work aims to bridge this gap by providing
  a thorough analysis of three types of potential annotation errors. We tackle the
  limitation of previous studies that lack a golden standard ground truth by performing
  our analysis on two synthetically-generated data sets with perfect labels, while
  also validating our observations on manually-labeled data. Moreover, we discuss
  the influence of the annotation errors on the results of three different network
  architectures: UNet, SegNet, and MSD. We find that UNet shows the overall best robustness
  for all data sets on two categories of errors, especially when the severity of the
  error is low, while MSD generalizes well even when a large proportion of the cell
  labels is missing during training. Moreover, we observe that special care should
  be taken to avoid wrongly labeling large objects when the target cells have small
  footprints.'
