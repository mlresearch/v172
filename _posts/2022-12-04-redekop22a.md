title: Attention-Guided Prostate Lesion Localization and Grade Group Classification
  with Multiple Instance Learning
abstract: Lesion localization is a component of prostate magnetic resonance imaging
  (MRI) evaluation and is essential for targeted biopsy by enabling registration with
  real-time ultrasound. Most previous work on prostate cancer localization has focused
  on classification or segmentation assuming the availability of radiology annotations.  In
  this work, we propose to use an unsupervised attention-based multiple instance learning
  (MIL) method in an application for the classification and localization of clinically
  significant prostate cancer. We train our model end-to-end with only image-level
  labels instead of relying on voxel-level annotations. We extend MIL method by operating
  both on patches and the whole size images to learn local and global features, which
  improves classification and localization performance. To better leverage the relationships
  between multi-modal data, we use an architecture with multiple encoding paths, where
  each path processes one image modality. The model was developed on a dataset containing
  986 multiparametric prostate MRIs and achieved $0.75 \pm  0.03$ AUROC using 3-fold
  cross-validation in prostate cancer Grade Group classification. Lesion localization
  analysis showed 70-80% sensitivity for GG $\ge$  3 at less than one false positive
  (FP) per patient and 65% of GG2 at one FP per patient.
