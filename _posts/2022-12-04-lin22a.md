title: Vision Transformers Enable Fast and Robust Accelerated MRI
abstract: The Vision Transformer, when trained or pre-trained on datasets consisting
  of millions of images, gives excellent accuracy for image classification tasks and
  offers computational savings relative to convolutional neural networks. Motivated
  by potential accuracy gains and computational savings, we study Vision Transformers
  for accelerated magnetic resonance image reconstruction. We show that, when trained
  on the fastMRI dataset, a popular dataset for accelerated MRI only consisting of
  thousands of images, a Vision Transformer tailored to image reconstruction yields
  on par reconstruction accuracy with the U-net while enjoying higher throughput and
  less memory consumption. Furthermore, as Transformers are known to perform best
  with large-scale pre-training, but MRI data is costly to obtain, we propose a simple
  yet effective pre-training, which solely relies on big natural image datasets, such
  as ImageNet. We show that pre-training the Vision Transformer drastically improves
  training data efficiency for accelerated MRI, and increases robustness towards anatomy
  shifts. In the regime where only 100 MRI training images are available, the pre-trained
  Vision Transformer achieves significantly better image quality than pre-trained
  convolutional networks and the current state-of-the-art. Our code is available at
