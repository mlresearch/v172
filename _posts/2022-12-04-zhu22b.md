title: Region Aware Transformer for Automatic Breast Ultrasound Tumor Segmentation
abstract: Although Automatic Breast Ultrasound (ABUS) has become an important tool
  to detect breast cancer, computer-aided diagnosis requires accurate segmentation
  of tumors on ABUS. In this paper, we propose the Region Aware Transformer Network
  (RAT-Net) for tumor segmentation on ABUS images. RAT-Net incorporates region prior
  information of tumors into network design. The specially designed Region Aware Self-Attention
  Block (RASAB) and Region Aware Transformer Block (RATB) fuse the tumor region information
  into multi-scale features to obtain accurate segmentation. To the best of our knowledge,
  it is the first time that tumor region distributions are incorporated into network
  architectures for ABUS image segmentation. Experimental results on a dataset of
  256 subjects (330 ABUS images each) show that RAT-Net outperforms other state-of-the-art
  methods.
