title: 'Hidden in Plain Sight: Subgroup Shifts Escape OOD Detection'
abstract: The safe application of machine learning systems in healthcare relies on
  valid performance claims. Such  claims are typically established in a clinical validation
  setting designed to be as close as possible to the intended use, but inadvertent
  domain or population shifts remain a fundamental problem. In particular, subgroups
  may be differently represented in the data distribution in the validation  compared
  to the application setting. For example, algorithms trained on population cohort
  data spanning all age groups may be predominantly applied in elderly people. While
  these data are not “out-of distribution”, changes in the prevalence of different
  subgroups may have considerable impact on algorithm performance or will at least
  render original performance claims invalid. Both are serious problems for safely
  deploying machine learning systems. In this paper, we demonstrate the fundamental
  limitations of individual example out-of-distribution detection for such scenarios,
  and show that subgroup shifts can be detected on a population-level instead. We
  formulate population-level shift detection in the framework of statistical hypothesis
  testing and show that recent state-of-the-art statistical tests can be effectively
  applied to subgroup shift detection in a synthetic scenario as well as real histopathology
  images.
