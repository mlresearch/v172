title: Hybrid Ladder Transformers with Efficient Parallel-Cross Attention for Medical
  Image Segmentation
abstract: "Most existing transformer-based network architectures for computer vision
  tasks are large (in number of parameters) and require large-scale datasets for training.
  However, the\rrelatively small number of data samples in medical imaging compared
  to the datasets for vision applications makes it difficult to effectively train
  transformers for medical imaging\rapplications. Further, transformer-based architectures
  encode long-range dependencies in the data and are able to learn more global representations.
  This could bridge the gap with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which primarily
  operate on features extracted in local image neighbourhoods. In this work, we present
  a hybrid transformer-based approach for segmentation of medical images that works
  in conjunction with a CNN. We propose to use learnable global attention heads along
  with the traditional convolutional segmentation network architecture to encode long-range
  dependencies. Specifically, in our proposed architecture the local information extracted
  by the convolution operations and the global information learned by the self-attention
  mechanisms are fused using bi-directional cross attention during the encoding process,
  resulting in what we call a hybrid ladder transformer (HyLT). We evaluate the proposed
  network on two different medical image segmentation datasets. The results show that
  it achieves better results than the relevant CNN- and transformer-based architectures"
