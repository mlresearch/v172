title: 'A Modular Deep Learning Pipeline for Cell Culture Analysis: Investigating
  the Proliferation of Cardiomyocytes'
abstract: Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death in the Western world.
  The exploration of strategies to enhance the regenerative capacity of the mammalian
  heart is therefore of great interest. One approach is the treatment of isolated
  transgenic mouse cardiomyocytes (CMs) with potentially cell cycle-inducing substances
  and assessment if this results in atypical cell cycle activity or authentic cell
  division. This requires the tedious and cost intensive manual analysis of microscopy
  images. Recent advances have led to an increasing use of deep learning (DL) algorithms
  in cellular image analysis. While developments in image or single-cell classification
  are well advanced, multi-cell classification in crowded image scenarios remains
  a challenge. This is reinforced by typically smaller dataset sizes in such laboratory-specific
  analyses. In this paper, we propose a modular DL-based image analysis pipeline for
  multi-cell classification of mononuclear and binuclear CMs in confocal microscopy
  imaging data. We trisect the pipeline structure into preprocessing, modelling and
  postprocessing. We perform semantic segmentation to extract general image features,
  which are further analyzed in postprocessing. In total, we conduct 173 experiments.
  We benchmark 18 encoder-decoder model architectures, perform hyperparameter optimization
  across 28 runs, and conduct 127 experiments to evaluate dataset-related effects.
  The results show that our approach has great potential for automating specific cell
  culture analyses even with small datasets.
