title: Detecting Out-of-Distribution via an Unsupervised Uncertainty Estimation for
  Prostate Cancer Diagnosis
abstract: Artificial intelligence-based prostate cancer (PCa) detection models have
  been widely explored to assist clinical diagnosis. However, these trained models
  may generate erroneous results specifically on datasets that are not within training
  distribution. In this paper, we propose an approach to tackle this so-called out-of-distribution
  (OOD) data problem. Specifically, we devise an end-to-end unsupervised framework
  to estimate uncertainty values for cases analyzed by a previously trained PCa detection
  model. Our PCa detection model takes the inputs of bpMRI scans and through our proposed
  approach we identify OOD cases that are likely to generate degraded performance
  due to the data distribution shifts. The proposed OOD framework consists of two
  parts. First, an autoencoder-based reconstruction network is proposed, which learns
  discrete latent representations of in-distribution data. Second, the uncertainty
  is computed using perceptual loss that measures the distance between original and
  reconstructed images in the feature space of a pre-trained PCa detection network.
  The effectiveness of the proposed framework is evaluated on seven independent data
  collections with a total of 1,432 cases. The performance of pre-trained PCa detection
  model is significantly improved by excluding cases with high uncertainty.
