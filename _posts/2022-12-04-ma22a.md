title: Label conditioned segmentation
abstract: 'Semantic segmentation is an important task in computer vision that is often
  tackled with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). A CNN learns to produce pixel-level
  predictions through training on pairs of images and their corresponding ground-truth
  segmentation labels. For segmentation tasks with multiple classes, the standard
  approach is to use a network that computes a multi-channel probabilistic segmentation
  map, with each channel representing one class. In applications where the image grid
  size (e.g., when it is a 3D volume) and/or the number of labels is relatively large,
  the standard (baseline) approach can become prohibitively expensive for our computational
  resources. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method to address this
  challenge. In our approach, the segmentation network produces a single-channel output,
  while being conditioned on a single class label, which determines the output class
  of the network. Our method, called label conditioned segmentation (LCS), can be
  used to segment images with a very large number of classes, which might be infeasible
  for the baseline approach. We also demonstrate in the experiments that label conditioning
  can improve the accuracy of a given backbone architecture. Finally, as we show in
  our results, an LCS model can produce previously unseen fine-grained labels during
  inference time, when only coarse labels were available during training. We provide
